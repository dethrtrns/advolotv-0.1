# Phase 11: Deployment

## Objective
Deploy the Advolot application to a scalable, secure production environment. Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments, and integrate monitoring and logging for real-time performance tracking and issue detection. All steps must adhere to the project structure defined in `project-context.md`.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Prepare Production Environment
- **Action:**
  - Choose a suitable hosting provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Heroku, etc.) that supports containerized or serverless deployments.
  - Create production environment configuration files (e.g., `.env.production`) with essential secrets and settings such as:
    - `DATABASE_URL_PROD`
    - `JWT_SECRET`
    - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
    - Other cloud service credentials.
- **Notes:**
  - Store these files or secrets securely using vaults or environment secret management systems.

### 2. Build for Production
- **Action:**
  - **Backend (NestJS):**
    - Navigate to the backend directory and build the project:
      ```bash
      cd backend
      npm run build
      ```
  - **Frontend (Next.js):**
    - Navigate to the frontend directory and build the production bundle:
      ```bash
      cd ../frontend
      npm run build
      ```
- **Notes:**
  - Verify that builds run successfully and that no errors occur in a staging environment before deploying to production.

### 3. Set Up CI/CD Pipeline Automation
- **Action:**
  - Configure a CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions (or a similar CI/CD tool) to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
  - Create or update a workflow file (`.github/workflows/deployment.yml`) with steps to:
    - Checkout the repository.
    - Set up Node.js.
    - Install dependencies.
    - Build and test the project.
    - Deploy to production.
- **Example Workflow:**
  ```yaml
  name: Deployment

  on:
    push:
      branches:
        - main

  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v2
          with:
            node-version: '16'

        - name: Install Dependencies
          run: npm ci

        - name: Build Project
          run: |
            cd backend && npm run build
            cd ../frontend && npm run build

        - name: Deploy to Production
          run: |
            # Replace with your actual deployment command/script
            # Example for Heroku using Heroku CLI:
            cd backend && heroku container:push web -a your-backend-app-name
            cd ../frontend && heroku container:push web -a your-frontend-app-name
            heroku container:release web -a your-backend-app-name
            heroku container:release web -a your-frontend-app-name
  ```
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure deployment scripts and environment variables are secured.
  - Validate that the CI/CD pipeline executes successfully on each push to the main branch.

### 4. Set Up Monitoring and Logging
- **Action:**
  - Integrate monitoring tools such as Prometheus, New Relic, or CloudWatch to track application performance and health.
  - Configure logging services to capture and store application logs for analysis.
- **Notes:**
  - Set up alerts for critical metrics such as error rates, response times, and system outages.
  - Document configuration details in the project documentation for future reference.

### 5. Perform Production Readiness Testing
- **Action:**
  - Conduct thorough end-to-end testing in the staging environment to simulate real-user workflows (e.g., registration, appointment booking, payments).
  - Use load testing tools to validate that the system handles high traffic and usage.
- **Notes:**
  - Document test scenarios, expected results, and any remediation steps needed based on test outcomes.

### 6. Finalize Deployment Documentation
- **Action:**
  - Update the `deployment.md` file in the `docs/` directory with detailed deployment instructions, including:
    - Environment setup
    - CI/CD pipeline configuration
    - Monitoring and logging setup
    - Troubleshooting guidelines
  - Commit all deployment configurations and documentation updates.
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Phase 11: Configure deployment pipeline and production environment setup with monitoring"
    ```
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure the deployment documentation is clear and accessible to all team members.

## Expected Outcome
- A fully operational, production-ready application deployed on a scalable hosting provider.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines that reliably build, test, and deploy the application.
- Monitoring and logging systems in place to maintain high availability and swiftly address production issues.
- Comprehensive deployment documentation enabling smooth future updates and troubleshooting.
