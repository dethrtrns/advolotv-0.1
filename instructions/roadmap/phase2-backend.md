# Phase 2: Backend Development

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Build a robust backend architecture.
- **Expected Outcomes:** A fully operational server with API endpoints, middleware, and a database connection.
- **Estimated Completion Time:** 4 hours

## Prerequisites
- **Required Software/Tools:**
  - Node.js (v18+)
  - Database server (PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB)
- **Required Accounts/API Keys:** Database access credentials.
- **Required Knowledge/Skills:** RESTful API design, ExpressJS (or an alternative framework), database integration.
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** Properly configured development and test databases.

## Before You Begin
- Confirm Phase 1 (Project Setup) is complete.
- Ensure the database server is installed and is accessible.
- Verify that necessary network ports (e.g., 3000, 5000) are available.
- Backup configuration files if modifying existing setups.

### Basic Implementation

- **Fundamental Features:**
  - Set up the core server file (`server.js` or `app.js`).
  - Install and configure essential dependencies (Express, body-parser).
- **Core Setup Steps:**
  - Initialize the backend project structure.
  - Create a basic REST endpoint (e.g., a health check route).
- **Essential Configurations:**
  - Configure environment variables for database connections.
  - Set up basic logging (e.g., using Morgan).

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Server starts without runtime errors.
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns a success message.
- [ ] Environment variables load correctly.

#### Testing Steps
1. Start the server and inspect the console for startup errors.
2. Manually send a GET request to the health check endpoint.
3. Verify log outputs for proper request logging.

### Core Implementation

- **Main Functionality:**
  - Develop detailed API endpoints for CRUD operations.
  - Integrate middleware for security (e.g., helmet, CORS).
- **Key Integrations:**
  - Establish a connection to the database.
  - Integrate an ORM or query builder (e.g., Sequelize, Mongoose).
- **Primary Features:**
  - Build controller modules for handling different routes.
  - Implement centralized error handling middleware.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] All API endpoints respond with valid JSON data.
- [ ] Database connection is established successfully and queries return expected results.
- [ ] Middleware performs proper request sanitization and validation.

#### Testing Steps
1. Use Postman or cURL to test all API endpoints.
2. Execute sample CRUD operations on the database.
3. Check error logs for any unhandled exceptions.

---

### Advanced Implementation (Optional)

- **Complex Features:**
  - Implement advanced performance optimizations (e.g., caching strategies with Redis).
  - Set up a rate limiter for API endpoints.
- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - Add asynchronous job processing for heavy tasks.
  - Introduce GraphQL as an alternative to REST.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Enhance API response times through database indexing.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Caching mechanism speeds up endpoint responses.
- [ ] Rate limiting is successfully enforced under load.
- [ ] Advanced queries perform within acceptable time limits.

#### Testing Steps
1. Run load tests to assess performance improvements.
2. Simulate multiple simultaneous API calls to test rate limiting.
3. Validate that asynchronous tasks complete as expected.

### Common Gotchas

- **Known Issues and Solutions:**
  - Database connection failures due to incorrect credentials.
  - Missing middleware configurations.
- **Typical Configuration Mistakes:**
  - Hardcoding sensitive information.
  - Overlooking CORS settings.
- **Version Compatibility Issues:**
  - Mismatches between Node.js and database driver versions.

---

### Troubleshooting Guide

- **Error Messages and Resolutions:**
  - "Database Connection Error": Verify credentials and network accessibility.
  - "Middleware Not Found": Check import paths and middleware order.
- **Debugging Steps:**
  - Utilize detailed logging and error stack traces.
  - Test each middleware independently.
- **Support Resources:**
  - Official documentation for ExpressJS and the chosen ORM.
  - Community forums and GitHub issues.

---

### Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] Basic backend structure and server file are set up.
- [ ] Core API endpoints and middleware are implemented.
- [ ] Database connectivity is verified.
- [ ] All tests pass successfully and documentation is up-to-date.
- [ ] Code has undergone peer review.

---

### Verification Steps

1. **Component-level Verification:** Validate individual API routes and middleware functionality.
2. **Integration Verification:** Confirm seamless interaction between the backend and database.
3. **System-level Verification:** Execute end-to-end tests to verify overall backend functionality.
