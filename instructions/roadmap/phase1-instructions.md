# Phase 1: Project Setup

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Establish the initial project structure and environment.
- **Expected Outcomes:** Repository initialization, basic configuration files, and setup of essential tools.
- **Estimated Completion Time:** 2 hours

## Prerequisites
- **Required Software/Tools:**
  - Git (v2.30+)
  - Node.js (v18+)
- **Required Accounts/API Keys:** GitHub account for repository hosting.
- **Required Knowledge/Skills:** Familiarity with command line, Git, and Node.js basics.
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** Terminal access and a consistent development environment.

## Before You Begin
- Verify that Git and Node.js are installed.
- Check that common ports (e.g., 3000, 8080) are free.
- Confirm the system's PATH is correctly configured.
- **Note:** Ensure Phase 1 is completed before transitioning to Phase 2 (Backend Development).

### Basic Implementation

- **Fundamental Features:**
  - Initialize a new Git repository.
  - Create a main `README.md` outlining the project.
- **Core Setup Steps:**
  - Set up the initial folder structure.
  - Create a basic `package.json` (if applicable).
- **Essential Configurations:**
  - Add a `.gitignore` for Node modules and environment files.
  - Configure a rudimentary linter (e.g., ESLint).

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Repository initialized and pushed to remote.
- [ ] `package.json` is successfully created.
- [ ] Basic `.gitignore` is in place.

#### Testing Steps
1. Run `npm install` to verify dependency setup.
2. Manually review the repository structure.
3. Lint the code (if a linter is configured).

---

### Core Implementation

- **Main Functionality:**
  - Refine the project structure.
  - Establish coding standards and commit guidelines.
- **Key Integrations:**
  - Integrate a pre-commit hook (e.g., Husky) for linting.
  - Set up branch protection rules on the repository.
- **Primary Features:**
  - Develop initial boilerplate code for the project.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Commit hooks are active and enforce standards.
- [ ] Code reviews confirm structure adherence.
- [ ] Branch protection is enabled on the remote repository.

#### Testing Steps
1. Execute sample commits and ensure hooks run.
2. Conduct a walkthrough of the repository structure.
3. Perform manual code reviews on the initial commit.

---

### Advanced Implementation (Optional)

- **Complex Features:**
  - Adopt containerization (e.g., adding a `Dockerfile`).
  - Set up Continuous Integration (CI) using a tool like GitHub Actions.
- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - Implement a detailed code style guide.
  - Set up an initial deployment pipeline.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Modularize the project early for scalability.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Docker container builds without errors.
- [ ] CI pipeline executes successfully on commits.

#### Testing Steps
1. Build and run the Docker container locally.
2. Trigger the CI pipeline via a test commit.
3. Review CI logs for errors or warnings.

### Common Gotchas

- **Known Issues and Solutions:**
  - Missing dependencies due to an outdated Node version.
  - Incorrect `.gitignore` entries.
- **Typical Configuration Mistakes:**
  - Misconfigured hooks that block commits.
  - Overlooking environment variable setups.
- **Version Compatibility Issues:**
  - Incompatibility between Node.js versions and dependencies.

---

### Troubleshooting Guide

- **Error Messages and Resolutions:**
  - "Module not found" errors: Verify dependency installation.
  - "Permission denied" errors: Check file system permissions.
- **Debugging Steps:**
  - Use verbose logging with Git commands.
  - Check system paths and environment variables.
- **Support Resources:**
  - GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, official tool documentation.
