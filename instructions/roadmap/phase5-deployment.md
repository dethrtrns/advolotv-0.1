# Phase 5: Deployment

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Deploy the application to the target environment reliably.
- **Expected Outcomes:** A working deployment in development, staging, and production environments.
- **Estimated Completion Time:** 3 hours

## Prerequisites
- **Required Software/Tools:**
  - Docker (if containerizing)
  - Cloud/hosting environment (e.g., AWS, Heroku)
  - CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins)
- **Required Accounts/API Keys:** Cloud provider credentials.
- **Required Knowledge/Skills:** Understanding of deployment pipelines and server configurations.
- **Environment Setup Requirements:** A prepared deployment environment with necessary network configurations.

## Before You Begin
- Confirm the application has passed all tests (Phase 4).
- Ensure that necessary environment variables and secrets are set.
- Verify that backend (Phase 2) and frontend (Phase 3) components are fully developed.

### Basic Implementation

- **Fundamental Features:**
  - Create a basic deployment workflow.
  - Deploy to a development server for initial validation.
- **Core Setup Steps:**
  - Draft deployment scripts (shell scripts or CI/CD pipeline configurations).
  - Set up environment configuration files for deployment.
- **Essential Configurations:**
  - Define the staging environment.
  - Configure firewall and port settings as required.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Deployment script executes without errors.
- [ ] Application is accessible on the development server.
- [ ] Environment variables load appropriately.

#### Testing Steps
1. Run the deployment script.
2. Access the deployed application in a browser.
3. Check server logs for startup issues or error messages.

### Core Implementation

- **Main Functionality:**
  - Automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines.
  - Deploy to staging and, optionally, to production environments.
- **Key Integrations:**
  - Connect deployment pipelines to code repositories (e.g., via GitHub Actions).
  - Implement zero-downtime deployments and continuous delivery practices.
- **Primary Features:**
  - Set up rollback mechanisms for failed deployments.
  - Implement blue-green or canary deployment strategies if applicable.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline completes deployments without errors.
- [ ] Staging environment behaves consistently with production settings.
- [ ] Rollback procedures are tested and documented.

#### Testing Steps
1. Trigger a deployment through the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Manually verify that the staging environment works as expected.
3. Simulate a failure scenario to test the rollback strategy.

### Advanced Implementation (Optional)

- **Complex Features:**
  - Implement container orchestration using tools like Kubernetes.
  - Automate horizontal scaling and integrate comprehensive monitoring.
- **Optional Enhancements:**
  - Set up blue-green or canary deployments for phased rollouts.
  - Integrate advanced logging and performance monitoring dashboards.
- **Performance Optimizations:**
  - Ensure rapid scaling under load and minimize deployment downtime.

#### Validation Steps
- [ ] Container orchestration configurations deploy successfully.
- [ ] Blue-green/canary deployment mechanisms function as intended.
- [ ] Monitoring systems report expected performance metrics.

#### Testing Steps
1. Deploy using container orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes) and monitor metrics.
2. Test blue-green/canary deployments by switching active environments.
3. Simulate increased load to verify scalability and performance monitoring.

### Common Gotchas

- **Known Issues and Solutions:**
  - Deployment failures due to misconfigured environment variables.
  - Downtime during deployments if zero-downtime strategies aren't employed.
- **Typical Configuration Mistakes:**
  - Incorrect configuration of secrets or API keys in deployment scripts.
  - Selecting the wrong target environment.
- **Version Compatibility Issues:**
  - Incompatibilities in CI/CD pipeline scripts due to tool version differences.

---

### Troubleshooting Guide

- **Error Messages and Resolutions:**
  - "Deployment failed": Check CI/CD pipeline logs and verify environment settings.
  - "Service unavailable": Reassess firewall and network configurations.
- **Debugging Steps:**
  - Examine CI/CD logs for specific error codes.
  - Manually execute deployment commands for in-depth diagnostics.
- **Support Resources:**
  - Refer to cloud provider documentation and community support forums for CI/CD tools.

---

### Phase Completion Checklist

- [ ] Basic deployment workflow is successfully set up.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline deploys code reliably.
- [ ] Staging and production environments are accessible and stable.
- [ ] Rollback and monitoring procedures are implemented and tested.
- [ ] All deployment documentation is current.

---

### Verification Steps

1. **Component-level Verification:** Test deployment scripts and confirm that environment variables load correctly.
2. **Integration Verification:** Ensure that the CI/CD pipeline integrates properly with the code repository.
3. **System-level Verification:** Execute end-to-end deployment tests and verify overall application accessibility.
