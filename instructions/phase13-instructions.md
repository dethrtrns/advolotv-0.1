# Phase 13: Frontend Development

## Objective
Develop the key frontend features of the Advolot platform, including authentication pages, a responsive dashboard, and integration with core functionalities such as appointment scheduling, chat, document management, and notifications. Ensure proper use of Next.js, MantineUI, Tailwind CSS, React Query, and contextual routing, in alignment with the project-context guidelines and user flow as defined in [UserFlow.md](./UserFlow.md).

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Develop Authentication Pages
- **Action:**
  - Create login and registration pages for users.
  - Use MantineUI form components along with validation for input fields.
  - Integrate these pages with the backend authentication API.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create files at `frontend/src/pages/login.tsx` and `frontend/src/pages/register.tsx`.
  - Use React Hook Form (or similar) for handling form inputs and validations.
  - Display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure conditional UI logic based on authentication state.
  - For further details on the user journey, refer to [UserFlow.md](./UserFlow.md).

### 2. Build a Responsive Dashboard & Navigation
- **Action:**
  - Develop a dashboard page displaying role-based navigation for both Clients and Lawyers.
  - Implement navigation components that allow users to access different sections such as appointments, chat, documents, and notifications.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create a layout component (e.g., `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`) to wrap the dashboard and other pages.
  - Use MantineUI components such as `Navbar`, `Header`, and `Footer`.
  - Set up dynamic routing using Next.js routing conventions.
- **Notes:**
  - Design should adhere to the dual flow defined in [UserFlow.md]. The dashboard should display different menus and controls based on the user's role.
  
### 3. Integrate Core Functional Features
- **Action:**
  - Develop pages for:
    - **Appointment Scheduling:** A page where Clients can view available slots and book appointments.
    - **Real-time Chat:** A chat interface for live communication.
    - **Document Management:** A page to upload, view, and download documents.
    - **Notifications:** A page or panel to display in-app notifications.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create separate files under `frontend/src/pages/` (e.g., `appointments.tsx`, `chat.tsx`, `documents.tsx`, `notifications.tsx`).
  - For each feature, implement UI forms and integrate API calls using React Query.
  - Use MantineUI components and custom components as necessary.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure each page adheres to the overall style and structure.
  - Review [UserFlow.md](./UserFlow.md) for additional insights on expected user interactions.

### 4. State Management and API Integration
- **Action:**
  - Use React Query to handle server state, caching, and synchronization across components.
- **Instructions:**
  - Create custom hooks (e.g., `useAppointments`, `useChatMessages`) inside `frontend/src/hooks/` to encapsulate API calls.
  - Ensure that API calls maintain proper error handling and loading states.
- **Notes:**
  - Write clear comments and documentation within your hooks to facilitate future updates.

### 5. UI Testing & Feedback
- **Action:**
  - Write component tests for key UI elements and integration tests to validate interactions.
- **Instructions:**
  - Use React Testing Library and Jest to set up tests.
  - Cover cases such as successful login, appointment booking, and error handling.
- **Notes:**
  - Update test files regularly to cover new features.

### 6. Commit and Update Documentation
- **Action:**
  - Once all features are integrated and tested, commit your changes with a clear commit message:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Phase 13: Develop core frontend features including authentication, dashboard, appointments, chat, documents, and notifications"
    ```
  - Document feature usage and update the `README.md` with instructions for running and testing these pages.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure the frontend documentation reflects the integration with backend services and adapts to the navigation flow specified in [UserFlow.md](./UserFlow.md).

## Expected Outcome
- A fully functional, responsive frontend application that includes:
  - Secure authentication pages connected to the backend.
  - A role-based dashboard and navigation system tailored to Clients and Lawyers.
  - Integrated pages for appointment scheduling, real-time chat, document management, and notifications.
  - State management using React Query, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.
- Comprehensive tests and clear documentation supporting further development and onboarding.
