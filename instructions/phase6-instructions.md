# Phase 6: Real-Time Communication

## Objective
Implement robust real-time communication features to enable live chat between Clients and Lawyers. This phase uses Socket.io to create a responsive messaging system that integrates seamlessly with the backend and frontend. All changes adhere to the project structure defined in `project-context.md` and follow strict coding and documentation standards.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Create the Chat Module in the Backend
- **Action:**
  - Generate a new Chat module using the NestJS CLI:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    nest generate module chat
    ```
- **Notes:**
  - This module will encapsulate all functionality related to real-time messaging and chat management.

### 2. Real-Time Communication Setup
- **Action:**
  - Create a Chat module with a Socket.io gateway to handle messaging.
- **Notes:**
  - Refer to [UserFlow.md](./UserFlow.md) for the detailed chat interaction flow.

### 3. Implement the Socket.io Gateway
- **Action:**
  - Create a Socket.io gateway file (e.g., `chat.gateway.ts`) within the Chat module.
  - Configure the gateway to handle:
    - Establishing and terminating connections.
    - Joining chat rooms (if applicable).
    - Broadcasting messages to clients.
- **Example Code:**
  ```typescript
  // backend/src/chat/chat.gateway.ts
  import { WebSocketGateway, WebSocketServer, SubscribeMessage, MessageBody } from '@nestjs/websockets';
  import { Server } from 'socket.io';

  @WebSocketGateway({
    cors: {
      origin: '*',
    },
  })
  export class ChatGateway {
    @WebSocketServer()
    server: Server;

    @SubscribeMessage('sendMessage')
    handleSendMessage(@MessageBody() message: any): void {
      // Broadcast the incoming message to all connected clients
      this.server.emit('receiveMessage', message);
    }
  }
  ```
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure proper error handling and validation within the gateway.
  - Use environment variables to configure any sensitive settings if needed.

### 4. Secure Real-Time Communication
- **Action:**
  - Integrate authentication checks within the gateway to allow only authenticated users to establish connections.
  - Optionally, use middleware to intercept and validate JWT tokens prior to WebSocket handshake.
- **Notes:**
  - Extend the JWT strategy from Phase 3 for use in the socket gateway.
  - Maintain secure and authenticated messaging channels.

### 5. Frontend Chat Interface Development
- **Action:**
  - In the Next.js frontend, create a dedicated chat page (e.g., `/chat.tsx`).
  - Use MantineUI components to build a responsive chat interface with features like:
    - Displaying a list of messages.
    - A text input for sending new messages.
    - Real-time updates when messages are sent and received.
  - Integrate the Socket.io client:
    ```bash
    npm install socket.io-client
    ```
- **Example Instructions:**
  - Create a file at `frontend/src/pages/chat.tsx`.
  - Use React hooks (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`) to handle socket connection and updates.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure the component handles reconnection logic and error states gracefully.
  - Validate user inputs on the client side before sending messages.

### 6. Testing and Optimization
- **Action:**
  - Write unit tests for the Chat service and integration tests for the Socket.io events using Jest.
  - Use tools like Postman or custom scripts to simulate multiple user connections and verify proper message broadcasting.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure that load testing is performed to confirm that the system can handle multiple simultaneous connections.
  - Document common failure scenarios and implement fallback strategies.

### 7. Commit and Documentation
- **Action:**
  - Commit changes with a detailed commit message:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Phase 6: Implement real-time communication features using Socket.io for live chat"
    ```
  - Update API and system documentation to reflect the new chat functionality.
- **Notes:**
  - Ensure that documentation includes information on how to set up and test the real-time communication features.
  - Link any new configuration or environment changes to the `project-context.md`.

## Expected Outcome
- A fully functional real-time chat feature in the backend using NestJS and Socket.io.
- A user-friendly, responsive chat interface in the frontend that handles live messaging between Clients and Lawyers.
- Robust security implemented in the communication layer, ensuring only authenticated users can participate.
- Comprehensive tests and documentation to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
